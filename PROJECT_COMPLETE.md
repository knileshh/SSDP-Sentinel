## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Before Presentation)

#### 1. Export ML Model ⚠️ REQUIRED
```bash
# In your Jupyter notebook (SET_FINAL_OCT_25_[01]_.ipynb)
from sklearn2pmml import sklearn2pmml

# After training your Decision Tree model
sklearn2pmml(pipeline, "SSDP_flood_detection.pmml")

# Copy to project
cp SSDP_flood_detection.pmml \
   upnp-ssdp-detection/models/
```

#### 2. Build the Project
```bash
cd upnp-ssdp-detection

# Run setup (installs dependencies)
./scripts/setup.sh

# Build everything
make build

# Verify binary exists
ls -lh build/ssdp-sentinel
```

#### 3. Test Run (WSL2 on Windows)
```bash
# In WSL2 Ubuntu
sudo ./build/ssdp-sentinel -c configs/config.yaml

# You should see:
# ✓ Configuration loaded
# ✓ ML model loaded
# ✓ eBPF objects loaded
# ✓ XDP program attached
# ✓ SSDP Sentinel is running
```

#### 4. Prepare Demo Environment
